# Frunction

_Fraction of a function_

_Dependency injection in JavaScript should be easy_

Dependency-free library to handle complex async function, e.g. getServerSideProps in nextjs.

## Why

1. Do you need to split the code of a big single async function?
2. Do you want to reuse a part of async function in another one?
3. Do you want to configure dependency relation between async parts?
4. Do you want them to execute as soon as dependency is ready?
